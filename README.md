RandomDataGenertor:
This is a small project which generates random data using https://api.namefake.com/ api, just to ease of assigning values to a variable when you want to test something.
Currently it only generates random person names, address data.
The data can be retrieved in form of list,set and dict.
Since the data is fetched through api, the number of calls are limited to 10 records for now.
